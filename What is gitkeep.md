# What is .gitkeep file?

Functionality is easier whatever you can imagine. <br>
`.gitkeep` is usually empty and this file needs to save folders structure. Git version control system is ignoring empty folders. That's mean if you want to add empty folder in your project structure, you must place at least one file in there. It can be any named, but `.gitkeep` - is an informal agreement between all programmers about such files naming. <br>
And it is meaning of this strange at first sight file.ðŸ˜„
