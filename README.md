### My own knowledge base 

>I suppose, that this base will be great opportunity for me. Firstly, it's practice of my technical English skills. Secondly, this files let me save my knowledge in programming and find something faster. This repository opened only for interested people, who interested in me and my works. Here you can see, I think, many parts of my knowledge in programming. 

>Also here you can see files `_git.md` and `_markdown.md`. That's need me to know more about it.

### Installation 
If you want download this base (I mean, repository), just open `cmd` using Win+R keyboard shortcut in Windows, choose directory and use this command: 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/grnbows/own-knowledge-base.git 
``` 
But I think, that the best way to use it - open files in `GitHub` by browser using. 

Thanks for your attention and interest.
